We were roused from our sleep by a loud radar blip?"

:: lucky_star
It really WAS.
I mean, I had to expend some elbow grease to get a distress beacon set up...
...but yeah, it was pure luck that their mining ship was passing through the sector.
Because -- after three days out on that godforsaken rock --
I don't know that I could've lasted another three MINUTES without their intervention.
But hey. It's Christmastime. The season of miracles, right?
[[So they say.|alien_talk]] | [[You were alone on that moon?|alone_moon]]


:: actual_aliens
These were... I know how crazy it sounds, but they were real, live, xenobiological organisms.
Creepy little... I don't know, I've taken to calling them "occupiers."
Weird green lifeforms that got inside people, or inside rats -- living or dead --
and just kinda wore them around. Piloted them.
Made their eyes glow green like something out of a Stephen King story.
Not <i>Stand By Me,</i> but, like, one of the ones where something has creepy green eyes.
[[Kiefer Sutherland has creepy green eyes.^He's in <i>Stand By Me,</i> and his eyes are kinda weird.|kiefer]] | [[Aliens. That's... scary.|scary_aliens]]
//Stand By Me is a film adaptation of a Stephen King story; Kiefer Sutherland is one of the stars.


:: unicorn_news
Not to mention butt rainbows.
...Huh.
That's interesting.
[[What's interesting?|shiny_interest]] | [[Everything okay?|okay_interest]]


:: how_long_marooned
I was stranded out there for three long days.
I mean, three risings and settings of Tau Ceti. Not totally sure how they mapped to Earth days.
But it was a good thing the White Star got my distress call and showed up when they did...
...'cause I don't know that I could've lasted another three MINUTES without their intervention.
But hey. It's Christmastime. The season of miracles, right?
[[So they say.|alien_talk]] | [[You were alone on that moon?|alone_moon]]


:: alien_talk
You'd be surprised what you start believing...
...when a White Star literally drops out of the sky and saves the day.
It might've been LESS surprising if a unicorn had showed up...
...and pooped a rainbow bridge back to Earth out of its hindquarters.
(Hell, once I get back to Earth, I might just tell people that's what DID happen.)
[[That should go over well.^Folks are always looking for solid news on unicorn sightings, these days.|unicorn_news]] | [[You could probably start a cult.|start_cult]]


:: sorry_woke
Yeah, well. Anytime I'm not dreaming about aliens...
...it's only because I'm not dreaming about them YET.
It always happens eventually.
Speaking of the klaxons, I should really go check on what's happening.
And speaking of the aliens... I really hope it's not the aliens.
Lemme just get out of these pajamas and...
Huh.
That's interesting.
[[What's interesting?|shiny_interest]] | [[Everything okay?|okay_interest]]


:: how_long_home
<<set $mentionedtunguskite = true>>
I don't know exactly how long it'll take until we get back to Earth, honestly.
Mari -- she's the White Star's navigator -- has the course plotted, obviously.
I mean, that's her job, and I think she's usually pretty good at it.
But the problem is, the White Star's payload is throwing everything off.
I can... I'll try to explain. But later.
For right now... uh...
[[shiny_interest]]


:: StoryTitle
Lifeline: Silent Night 110415


:: not_poem
Yeah, well, you'll have to forgive me. I'm a science student, not English lit.
And while I wasn't exactly dreaming of sugar plums (whatever THOSE are)...
...I WAS actually enjoying my first solid sleep since I got off that moon.
This was the first night I hadn't woken up in a cold sweat, thinking about the Varia crew...
...with those weird green eyes and their supernatural strength...
...and instead, I damn near fall out of my bunk when the proximity klaxon goes off.
[[Slow down. Explain.^I have no idea what you're talking about.|slow_down]] | [[Is this who I think it is?^This story sounds familiar. Are you... Taylor?|are_you_taylor]]


:: whos_this
Oh, hey, that was rude of me. Sorry.
My name's Taylor.
Student astronaut, formerly of the Varia. Which was formerly a ship.
Until it got yanked out of the void and smashed to flinders on a desert moon in the Tau Ceti system.
So I scuttled around like a hermit crab whose shell had been hammered open...
...until this mining ship, the White Star, was kind enough to swoop in to my rescue.
[[Well, that was lucky.|lucky_star]] | [[Oh, yeah! Taylor! I know you!|know_taylor]]


:: know_taylor
Cool! I thought your keystrokes sounded familiar.
Good to be back in touch with you!
[[You too! How you been?|how_you_been]] | [[How long were you marooned?|how_long_marooned]]


:: alone_moon
Well, I guess I wasn't technically ALONE.
I had Captain Aya, although she wasn't (and still isn't) conscious...
...and I had the four lab rats I'd brought with me, to run experiments on.
Oh, and then, y'know... the aliens.
Shouldn't forget about the aliens.
<<if $alienmention is false>>[[What, like, illegal immigrants?|illegal_aliens]] | [[Or do you mean actual ALIENS?|actual_aliens]]
<<elseif $alienmention is true>>[[Yeah, you'd mentioned that.|mentioned_aliens]] | [[Do you mean actual ALIENS?|actual_aliens]]
<<endif>>


:: start_cult
Heh. Maybe so.
I always figured, the hardest part would be getting everyone to agree on the shoes.
A whole roomful of people who have to die in the same style of sneakers?
Sounds like a LOT of fashion arguments to have to deal w--
Huh.
That's interesting.
[[What's interesting?|shiny_interest]] | [[Everything okay?|okay_interest]]


:: safe_earth
Yeah, maybe. Whenever THAT might be.
[[how_long_home]]


:: okay_interest
Uh, yeah. Everything's okay, I think.
[[shiny_interest]]


:: weight_problem
Nope. Weight's not the issue. Out here in the vacuum of space, weight is essentially meaningless.
The White Star took as much as they could carry and still lift off.
Once they broke atmosphere, they were basically home free.
[[So what's the problem?|what_problem]] | [[What is the payload?|what_payload]]


:: what_payload
Like I think I said before, the White Star is a mining ship.
The reason they were out in my sector -- which is kinda the boondocks of outer space --
is because they were on a return trip from a planet that was even further out in the hinterlands.
One of those planets that's so uncharted, it doesn't even have a name. Just a number.
U33J6.
[[Sounds dreamy.^The sort of place you'd have a summer home.|summer_home]] | [[Why were they out there?|why_there]]


:: summer_home
Yeah, I'm sure it's basically the Hamptons with fewer golf courses and more craters.
(Which, come to think of it, would make it way easier to get a hole in one.)
[[why_there]]


:: StoryAuthor
Dave Justus


:: slow_down
Oh. Sorry. I guess I was getting a little ahead of myself.
My name's Taylor.
Student astronaut, formerly of the Varia. Which was formerly a ship.
Now it's two twisted, useless pieces of metal, crashed on a desert moon in the Tau Ceti system.
[[Yikes. Sounds rough.|rough_contact]] | [[Nice to meet you, Taylor.|nice_meet]]


:: are_you_taylor
Cadet Taylor, formerly of the Varia, at your service.
(As long as your service doesn't require much more than me rubbing the sleep boogers out of my eyes.)
Miss me?
[[I really did!|really_missed]] | [[Eh. Not that much.^I mean, let's be honest, you were kind of whiny.|kinda_whiny]]


:: how_you_been
Can't complain.
(Can ALWAYS complain.)
I'm a little banged up, a little shell-shocked, a little tired of eating MREs...
...oh, and a little "never want to have an alien try to crawl inside my mouth ever again."
But other than that, I'm great!
Didja miss me while I was gone?
[[Honestly, I really did.|really_missed]] | [[Eh. Not that much.^I mean, let's be honest, you were kind of whiny.|kinda_whiny]]


:: illegal_aliens
You know, I didn't think to check their work visas.
But no. I mean real, live, xenobiological organisms.
Creepy little... I don't know, I've taken to calling them "occupiers."
Weird green lifeforms that got inside people, or inside rats -- living or dead --
and just kinda wore them around. Piloted them.
Made their eyes glow green like something out of a Stephen King story.
Not <i>Stand By Me,</i> but, like, one of the ones where something has creepy green eyes.
[[Kiefer Sutherland has creepy green eyes.^He's in <i>Stand By Me,</i> and his eyes are kinda weird.|kiefer]] | [[Aliens. That's... scary.|scary_aliens]]
//Stand By Me is a film adaptation of a Stephen King story; Kiefer Sutherland is one of the stars.


:: mentioned_aliens
Yeah, well... it's the kind of thing one mentions.
[[actual_aliens]]


:: shiny_interest
I just... I saw something out of the corner of my eye. Through the window.
Something shiny.
Which one does not expect to see in deep space.
[[What was it?|shiny_okay]] | [[A satellite, maybe?^Or something else man-made, like a probe?|manmade_object]]


:: manmade_object
Um... maybe?
Qualified maybe?
We're not exactly in a heavily trafficked sector. Or even a lightly trafficked sector.
"Traffic" isn't really a concept out here.
So to suddenly spot something on the galactic on-ramp... it's kinda weird.
[[Well, what was it?|shiny_okay]] | [[So, NOT man-made, then?^If it wasn't made by humans... where did it come from?|shiny_okay_2]]

:: shiny_okay_2
[[shiny_okay]]

:: what_problem
The problem isn't the WEIGHT of what we're carrying...
...it's the nature of what we're carrying.
And if you think I fully understand the nature of what's in the cargo bay, think again.
[[what_payload]]


:: why_there
They traveled out to the planet because it's in a tight orbit around a black hole.
It's stable enough that it dances just outside the event horizon...
...but the hole has strange effects on the planet.
And on a particular mineral out there, specifically, which is what they were sent to mine.
[[What mineral?|what_mineral]] | [[What kind of effects?|what_effects]]


:: not_dead
<<set $alienmention = true>>
There was... SOMETHING out there on that moon. Some alien force.
It took over my lab rats and... animated them, I guess, is the right phrase.
Then it took over the Varia crew.
And it tried to take ME over, too. By climbing in through my mouth.
[[Aliens. Like, ACTUAL aliens?|actual_aliens]] | [[That sounds terrifying.|scary_aliens]]


:: kiefer
Oh, that dude. Actually, he had one green eye and one blue.
That's why they look so "creepy" to you.
It's a genetic condition called heterochromia. I learned about it back in class.
But as far as I know, Kiefer Sutherland never tried to climb inside anyone's mouth and pilot them around.
AS FAR AS I KNOW.
[[We can never be 100% sure.|never_sure]] | [[Okay. Seriously. Aliens?|scary_aliens]]



:: scary_aliens
<<if $mentioned_again_visited is true>>
By the time I realized I wasn't alone out there, there were about a thousand other things happening...
<<else>>It really WAS scary.
By the time I realized I wasn't alone out there, there were about a thousand other things happening...<<endif>>
...a graveyard of derelict ships, a bank of computer controls inside a mountain...
...a pulse weapon that was shooting targets out of space and time...
...and, worst of all, I was down to my last package of chili macaroni...
...so I almost didn't have time to be freaked out by the aliens.
But ever since I left that moon, they're all I've been able to think about.
And I'm guessing the nightmares aren't going away anytime soon.
[[Maybe once you're back home.^Once you're back on Earth soil, maybe you'll feel safe again.|safe_earth]] | [[Sorry the alarm woke you.^Sounded like you were sleeping okay, until the klaxons went off.|sorry_woke]]

:: mentioned_again
<<set $mentioned_again_visited = true>>
Yeah, well, I'm good at mentioning things.
Did I not mention that?
Anyway.
[[scary_aliens]]

:: never_sure
Good point. I mean, his dad Donald was a pod person, right?
That kind of thing is probably genetic.
ANYWAY. We're getting off topic. I'm pretty good at tangents. Ask anyone.
But yeah. Just me and a bunch of aliens out on that rock.
[[Yeah, you'd mentioned that.|mentioned_again]] | [[Sounds scary.|scary_aliens]]


:: why_me_2
[[why_me]]

:: why_me
This, uh... I don't know how much of it you, personally, have seen...
...but this is a HUGE universe, and a lot of it is pretty scary.
And even now -- as a guest on a ship, surrounded by seemingly cool folks --
I'm a little freaked out.
But talking to you on a gauntlet communicator like this -- a speech-to-text thing --
you got me through an impossibly hard time once, already.
Kept me from dying. Kept me, more importantly, from getting distracted.
That's not the kind of thing I'm likely to forget about anytime soo--
HEY LOOK something shiny!
[[You're an idiot.^You're like a magpie of a human being, you know that?|magpie_person]] | [[What? What is it?|whats_shiny]]


:: really_missed
Hey. Seriously. That's kind of you to say.
I know, before -- when you were helping me on that moon -- I wasn't always at my best.
(Let's not sugarcoat it. That was the second-worst time of my entire life.)
(It goes without saying that the worst was junior prom.)
But you stuck it out with me, and we made it through.
Together.
Which is why I'm getting hold of you again now.
[[Yeah... why me?|why_me]] | [[You're not alone out there.^There are other people on that ship. You don't have to rely on me for company.|why_me_2]]





:: what_effects
Look, I'm no astrophysicist.
So let me try to explain this in layperson's terms that we can both comprehend:
It weirds them minerals up REAL NICE.
[[tunguskite]]


:: what_mineral
It's called "tunguskite."
And as far as what it actually IS, or DOES... I'm kind of at a loss.
[[tunguskite]]


:: nice_meet
Thanks. You too.
You, uh, probably think it's weird that I decided to reach out...
...to strike up a conversation with a stranger across the whole of time and space.
This, uh... I don't know how much of it you, personally, have seen...
...but this is a HUGE universe, and a lot of it is pretty scary.
And even now -- as a guest on a ship, surrounded by seemingly cool folks --
I'm a little freaked out.
But a gauntlet communicator like this -- a little speech-to-text thing --
it got me through an impossibly hard time once, already, back on that moon.
Kept me from dying. Kept me, more importantly, from getting distracted.
That's not the kind of thing I'm likely to forget about anytime soo--
HEY LOOK something shiny!
[[You're an idiot.^You're like a magpie of a human being, you know that?|magpie_person]] | [[What? What is it?|whats_shiny]]





:: rough_contact
Yeah. "Rough" is, uh, is one word for it.
This, uh... I don't know how much of it you, personally, have seen...
...but this is a HUGE universe, and a lot of it is definitely rough.
And even now -- as a guest on a ship, surrounded by seemingly cool folks --
I'm a little freaked out.
And that's why I fired up this gauntlet communicator, this little speech-to-text thing.
It reached out across the cosmos and tapped you on the shoulder...
...whoever and wherever you are.
I did this once before, on that moon -- staying in contact with someone through it all.
It got me through an impossibly hard time.
Anyway. Like I was saying, my old ship, the Varia, crashed on that moon.
The rest of the crew... well, I managed to get my injured captain into a stasis pod...
...but everyone else was dead.
And then, after a couple of days... they WEREN'T.
[[What does THAT mean?|not_dead]] | [[How long were you marooned?|how_long_marooned]]


:: magpie_person
That's just an old wives' tale, you know.
They've done plenty of studies that prove that magpies don't care about stealing shiny objects.
They actually tend to avoid them.
Trust me, I nearly completed some science classes. So I know what I'm talking about.
[[Okay. Fine. So what's shiny now?|whats_shiny]] | [[Is everything okay there?|shiny_okay]]


:: whats_shiny
I... I can't really tell.
It's moving... fast enough that I have to think it's powered.
This isn't just some asteroid out for a lazy Sunday stroll...
...this is... a vessel.
Which explains the alarms, which, OKAY, WE GET IT, could we turn them off now?
[[Is it another ship?|shiny_okay]] | [[Maybe it's just a comet.^There's all sorts of junk in space. No need to freak out.|no_freak]]


:: kinda_whiny
Hey, you know what? That's fair.
I guess I DID complain a little, while I stumbled around a desert moon alone...
...injuring various parts of my body and nearly starving to death...
...before ultimately encountering a malevolent alien force that was ripping starships out of time and space.
Maybe I DID whine just a little.
Let's trade places sometime. See if YOU make it through all that without so much as a deep sigh.
[[Yeah, yeah. Why contact me?|why_me_whine]] | [[No way. I'm tough.|im_tough]]


:: why_me_whine
Honestly? Because... I think you're good for me.
I know that sounds cheesy, but I mean it.
This is a HUGE universe, and a lot of it is pretty frightening...
...and even now -- as a guest on a ship, surrounded by seemingly cool folks --
I'm a little freaked out.
But talking to you on a gauntlet communicator like this -- a speech-to-text thing --
you got me through an impossibly hard time once, already.
Kept me from dying. Kept me, more importantly, from getting distracted.
You're the kind of person I want in my corner, when the weird stuff starts going down.
To listen to me whine... and to snap me out of it.
[[You've earned a LITTLE whining.|earned_whine]] | [[Stay tough. Like me.|im_tough]]


:: shiny_okay
<<set $mapmention = true>>
That's... a really good question.
The starboard viewport in the crew quarters gives a pretty narrow view out into space.
I'm betting I could get a better look at things --
plus, you know, some instrumental readouts, and the expertise of the rest of the crew --
if I made my way up to the cockpit.
(Plus, this communicator comes complete with a dynamic map...
...so YOU can see where I go in the ship, anytime I go in the ship.)
(So, kind of a bonus for you, yeah?)
[[Totally. Head to the cockpit.|go_to_cockpit]] | [[No, stay in your quarters.|stay_in_quarters]]


:: crew_handle
Yes. Sure. Of course you're right.
There are protocols for EVERYTHING.
Just like... just like the Varia had protocols for being wrenched out of spacetime.
Oh, no, wait, that's right, we totally DIDN'T.
My mistake.
Dead. Dead. Dead. We're totally dead.
[[You're NOT dead. Relax.^You've seen some crazy crap. You're on edge. But you'll be fine.|not_dead_yet]] | [[What does this thing look like?|shiny_okay]]


:: tunguskite
The mineral is crystalline, with a complex lattice structure.
That structure appears to be uniquely efficient...
...at capturing and storing negative energy generated by Hawking radiation.
And since the quantum effects of black holes at the event horizon...
...mean that they're spewing Hawking radiation like a freshman who's had one too many wine coolers...
...this tunguskite is in the right place, at the right time...
...to soak up all sorts of stuff that we've otherwise had no way of preserving.
[[You lost me.^There were a few too many science words to follow in there.|too_much_science]] | [[You're hauling negative energy?|hauling_neg]]


:: no_freak
Okay, first of all, I am NOT freaking out.
Secondly, if I AM freaking out, it's because it's recently come to my attention that, yes...
...there IS all sorts of junk in space...
...and some of it is overwhelmingly hostile. With green eyes and whatnot.
So, third and finally, THAT is why I'm freaking out.
[[Just stay calm.^Whatever this is, I'm sure the White Star crew can handle it.|crew_handle]] | [[Do you think it's a ship?|shiny_okay]]


:: earned_whine
Yes! Thank you.
I'll try not to abuse the privilege.
Like, right now, I'm making a conscious choice not to whine about the shiny object...
...glistening out in space, off the starboard-side viewport...
...even though I don't know what it is...
...and it's super, uh... super distracting...
[[Hey, snap out of it!^You're like a magpie of a human being, you know that?|magpie_person]] | [[What? What's out there?|whats_shiny]]


:: im_tough
Oh, man. I must've been gone from Earth longer than I thought.
They've had time to change the definition of "tough" to "delusional."
What else have I missed? Does "up" mean "down"? Has "in" become "out"?
Did they retitle that one Nick Nolte movie <i>Up And In Out Beverly Hills</i>?
[[Shouldn't you check that alarm?^This sarcasm isn't helping you figure out what's closing in.|closing_in]] | [[Can the jokes; check the radar.|check_radar]]
//Nick Nolte movie's original title is Down And Out In Beverly Hills.


:: closing_in
Or figure in what's closing out.
(Sorry.)
[[check_radar]]


:: hauling_neg
I think that's the long and short of it, yeah.
The crystals absorb virtual particles that are only supposed to last briefly...
...and keep them around indefinitely.
(Which, frankly, doesn't sound all that safe to me. But what do I know?)
[[Yeah... sounds dangerous.|danger_crystals]] | [[How is it throwing you off course?|off_course]]


:: too_much_science
Look, I'm a science student, and *I* don't understand half of what I just said.
We've got magic moon rocks with wibbly wobbly timey wimey powers, okay?
We've got a zoo full of Pet Rocks that maybe haven't been domesticated yet.
So there's a good chance they'll bite, or pee on the floor.
[[Doesn't sound like fun.^So, that sounds like a potentially volatile situation.|danger_crystals]] | [[How are they throwing you off course?|off_course]]
//Idiom: "wibbly wobbly timey wimey" is a Doctor Who phrase.


:: not_dead_yet
Aw, even if I WERE dead, something would probably just crawl inside my mouth...
...and wear me around like some kind of Taylor suit.
So people would think I was still alive, just going about my business...
...probably no one would even notice that the real me was dead.
[[I bet you'd talk less.|talk_less]] | [[Enough. Go look at the shiny thing.^All this panic... and can you even tell what this thing is?|shiny_okay]]


:: stay_in_quarters
Um. Well. I guess that IS an option.
I feel like my thumbs are dangerously over-twiddled, these last couple days...
...but, sure, if I sit here long enough, someone will eventually come by and tell me what's up.
I was halfway out of my pajamas and into my "go to the cockpit" clothes, though...
...so I should probably commit one way or the other.
[[All right. Go to the cockpit.|cockpit_okay]] | [[Just stay put.^No need to go running up there. You'll hear about the shiny thing eventually.|stay_put]]


:: go_to_cockpit
<<set $maploc = "hall">>
Good plan.
(Especially since I already had my pajamas halfway off to get changed into a pullover.)
Gimme a minute to get dressed and get up there, and I'll catch up with you.
[[delay 30s^Taylor is prepping|cockpit_first]]


:: miss_talk
Of course you would. I'm a thrilling conversationalist.
I tell you what. We'll make a deal.
If I EVER stop making dumb puns and pop culture references...
...you'll know that an alien has taken me over, and I'm not in control of my own mind anymore.
At which point you should figure out a way to kill me, okay?
Because a life where I'm not making <i>Fantasy Island</i> jokes on the regular?
That's no life at all.
[[It's a deal.|kill_deal]] | [[Smiles, everyone, smiles.|smiles]]


:: check_radar
<<set $maploc = "hall">>
Outdated pop culture references are my way of deflecting anxiety.
I'm jostled out of a sound sleep by a blaring siren, I start making Duran Duran jokes.
It's just a reflex.
(Fle-fle-fle-fle-flex.)
Anyhow, you're probably right. I should see what this alarm is all about.
<<if $mapmention is false>>(Plus, hey, this communicator comes complete with a dynamic map...

[[delay 30s^Taylor is prepping|cockpit_first]]


:: cockpit_first
<<set $maploc = "cockpit">>
All right. Alarms are off, so I can finally think straight, and I'm at the cockpit.
(Remind me sometime to do my standup routine on how the various parts of the spaceship got their names.)
Or, well, I'm NEAR the cockpit, because everyone else on the crew is crowded in there already.
Captain Shepherd's at the helm, obviously. I don't think I've ever NOT seen her there.
Mari's working the nav computer. Dr. Artesa, the shipboard medic, is wedged in behind her.
And then the miners -- the three guys who dropped down planetside to rescue me.
Donald, Aries, and Bos. My heroes.
Ah. Never mind. I'm running off at the mouth. You don't wanna hear about the crew.
[[Of course I do.^Sure, tell me all about them. I'm interested.|describe_crew]] | [[You're right, I don't.^The descriptions you just gave me are plenty, thanks.|no_describe_crew]]


:: time_theory
Look, I'm working with the facts I've got, here.
(And "facts" is probably being fairly generous.)
If you have a more solid hypothesis for how this all works...
...write it down, stick it in an envelope, Scotch tape it to a rocket...
...and it'll probably get to me, sooner or later.
<<if $nav_code_visited is true>>[[cockpit_crystals]]
<<else>>Anyhow, I --
Huh.
That's interesting.
[[What's interesting?|shiny_interest]] | [[Everything okay?|okay_interest]]<<endif>>


:: how_moon
There was this weird peak that the aliens -- the occupiers -- seemed to have built.
It was pulling starships out of space, but more importantly...
...out of TIME.
The peak itself would shimmer and fade in and out of phase with existence...
...and when I was inside it, so did I.
When that happened, time flowed differently until the peak stabilized again.
All of which was totally incomprehensible while it was happening...
...but it makes a LOT more sense now that I know about these crystals.
[[Sure. It makes "sense."|makes_sense]] | [[That's... quite a theory.|time_theory]]


:: off_course
Apparently there are some weird time dilation effects with these things.
I think... it's not too much of a leap to make a bit of a leap:
I reckon there was some tunguskite involved in my stay out on that moon.
[[How do you figure?|how_moon]] | [[Oh, I think I follow.^You're talking about when you were inside the peak, right?|inside_peak]]


:: danger_crystals
Yeah, I agree. I think this was probably a hell of a dangerous mission.
Which, confidentially, makes sense...
<<if $nav_code_visited is true>>...because Aries told me it was the best money he'd ever gotten for a gig.
(That's not even counting if they get some kind of hazard pay for coming to my rescue.)
But yeah, the crystals throw the ship off course.
[[off_course_two]]
<<else>>...because one of the miners, Aries, told me it was the best money he'd ever gotten for a gig.

//Flux capacitor is from Back To The Future.


:: inside_peak
Right, exactly! You remember.
The pulse weapon in that peak was pulling ships out of spacetime...
...and the whole structure would blink out of existence.
And as someone who was inside it when it did that, I can tell you...
...time moved totally differently until it restabilized.
It felt kinda like riding a rollercoaster made out of broken watches.
But if the peak's systems were powered by these crystals, somehow...
...well, I guess it all makes a lot more sense.
[[I guess that's one theory.|time_theory]] | [[I wouldn't call it "sense."|makes_sense]]

They mess with the navigational software, apparently.

She has a soft voice, but it carries a hell of a lot of authority.

Did you ever see the movie <i>Flash Gordon</i>? Donald looks like that guy, Sam Jones.
I'm guessing he got the job just by handing in a head shot with "space hero" written on it.

At least if I go check on things, I'll know --

I'll know what KIND of dicey situation I'm up against.
(Or maybe I'll luck out and it'll be a regular, non-dicey situation instead.)

Yeah. Okay. Good idea, I guess.
It's always a good idea for the youngest, least experienced person on board...
...to go wandering the halls in the middle of a crisis, just hoping for the best.
Hoping the hockey-masked killer doesn't jump out and get me.
(Seriously, there was a <i>Friday The 13th</i> movie with Jason in space.)

Maybe I need to suit up or something. Maybe we're meeting for a briefing.

In the corridor outside.
They were pretty light and distant at first, and I was trying to ignore them...

At the door.

Uh, yeah.
Allow me to paint you a mind-picture with my word-brushes.
There IS nowhere to hide in the crew quarters.
I could make an adorable fort out of a couple mattresses...
...but in terms of stealthiness, I'd rate that somewhere below just shouting "HERE I AM!"
If this is a hide-and-seek situation, it's about to be olly-olly-oxen-free.

I was about to say, "this blackout isn't going to help anything."
But then I smacked my shin against something in the dark, and actions spoke louder than words.
I'm gonna go silent for a bit, so I can really carefully pick my way up there...

You, uh... you don't strike me as a guy who scares easy, Bos.

<bos>I think it was two men, one woman, but their suits were bulky so it was hard to tell --</bos>
<bos>come in through the dorsal airlock and into the Ready Room...</bos>
<bos>...and just start beating the hell out of Key.</bos>
<bos>No words, no explanation, nothing. They just went to town on him.</bos>
They... they attacked Donald? Why would they do that?
<bos>Hell if I know. I went to try to break it up, and one of 'em shoved me.</bos>
<bos>Taylor, it was... I've never felt anything so strong.</bos>
<bos>I hit the doorframe so hard, I'm pretty damn sure I broke a couple ribs.</bos>
<bos>Freaked me the hell out. So I took off.</bos>
<bos>I'm trying to find Aries. I figure, the two of us together, maybe we stand a chance.</bos>
If... if I see him, I'll tell him you're looking for him.
<bos>Good deal. I'm gonna sweep the ship and then hole up in the drill control room.</bos>
<bos>Tell him to meet me there, if you run into him. Thanks, Taylor.</bos>
And like that, he's gone.
Whoever these visitors are... if they can do that to a juggernaut like Bos...
...I don't stand a snowball's chance if I run into them.

If I started pooping little chocolate bunny eggs...
...I'd be the most popular person on the White Star by an order of magnitude.

<<set $maploc = "hall">>
I'm looking both directions down the corridor...
...but let's be honest, in this darkness, I can't see more than a few feet either way.
So. There's one of these occupier things loose in the White Star.
[[At LEAST one.|at_least]] | [[What will you do about it?|what_next_alien]]


:: still_room
Crap. Crap!
In the dark like this, it's impossible to tell whether it's still in here or not.
So... here's what I can do.
These little creeps get into their hosts through the mouth.
Captain Aya's got a breathing mask on, so there isn't ready access to her mouth.
Doc Artesa... I can stuff his mouth with gauze.
Which sounds cruel -- and maybe it is -- but I could be doing him a huge favor.
Or... I could potentially be killing him.
In the event that he vomits, he'd be pretty likely to aspirate and choke to death.
What do you think?
[[Stuff his mouth.|stuff_him]] | [[Don't stuff his mouth.|no_stuff]]


:: doc_done
All right! Doc Artesa is off the chessboard.
Captain Aya can breathe easy -- or, as easy as those machines will let her.
And now all that's left for me to do is to grab that occupier.

...Yes. And we should base all our plans on how much fun they are to say.
So I'm just gonna run around the ship, all helter skelter.
All hither and thither. All nimbly-bimbly from tree to tree.
Or really, I'm going to move at a reasonable pace and try not to bang my knee again.
I'll get hold of you again if I find the occupier...

Especially because it means that, if anyone on board wants to do me harm...
...they've got a pretty enormous tactical advantage over me.
In that I won't see them coming until it's way too late.

It's utilitarian. Not meant to be pretty. Not a place you'd want to hang out.

So you'd expect the whole, vast room to be impossibly dark right now.
But it isn't.
[[Why? What's lit up?|what_light]] | [[Oh, because your helmet light's on.|helmet_light]]


:: what_light
It's the tunguskite itself.
The crystals... they have their own sort of inner light.
I've seen "glow-in-the-dark" rocks before -- calcite, sodalite, fluorite --
but those things buzz for just a few seconds after the light source is gone.
Even zinc sulfide, the champion of them all, only lasts for a minute or two.
But this tunguskite... it never stops.
[[That's pretty weird.|weird_crystals]] | [[Is it dangerous?|dangerous_crystals]]


:: weird_crystals
I agree. I've never heard of anything like it.
(I mean, granted, I've never heard of HALF the things I've encountered out here.)
It's... it's weirdly beautiful, though, to be standing in an enormous room...
...and surrounded by magic light-up rocks as far as the eye can see.
I feel like a deleted scene from the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy.
(Did they delete any scenes from that? Feels like they used EVERYTHING.)

Right? Or if nobody's up there, I hope they at least have a cool autopilot.

ONE of 'em disintegrated in a garage. You go look that up while I make my way to the cockpit.

Not... not really. I'm on a long stretch of hall...

I hadn't even thought to try to fix it. Wasn't really anticipating a need.
No, this is something... altogether more interesting.

:: dangerous_crystals
We don't... THINK so?
Even though the crystals are storing energy generated by Hawking radiation...
...they don't appear to be leaking it at all.
The lattice is a highly efficient containment matrix.
We've got a ship full of this stuff, and the Geiger counter hasn't moved at all.
As impossible as it sounds, the tunguskite seems totally safe.
Even though it's crammed full of more negative energy than a Joy Division fansite.

Look, under any other circumstances, I would...
...but when I stop to think about it, if he's got an occupier inside him...
...he's as good as dead anyway, right?
And even if there IS some chance of curing him...
...that can't possibly happen if I don't escape and live to help get us all to safety!
So I'm gonna think happy thoughts for Donald Key...
...and that's just gonna have to be enough.
Now: How about I get the hell out of here?

I mean... I guess I CAN... but there's really nothing else in here except more crystals.
They managed to mine a pretty impressive amount of these things from U33J6.
I know that the crystals regrow -- slowly but surely --
so it's not like they stripped the planet bare.
And they calculated how much extra room they'd need in the cargo bay...
...so the growth wouldn't overtake the free space before they got back to Earth.
(Although, with the navs all screwy, who knows how accurate those projections are?)
So I don't know what good it'd do me to keep poking around in here, really.

And unfortunately (or, I don't know, maybe fortunately), there's no window in that door.
So I have no idea whether this is friend or foe...
...and they probably have no idea that I'm in here.
All they know is, their old code won't work.
What should I do?
[[Ask who it is.|ask_who]] | [[Keep quiet.|keep_quiet]]

No, indeed. Few things are.
Okay. Everything's mixed down. I just have to let it cool off in the fridge.
Wait for the saltpeter crystals to form...
...do a little grinding and mixing, like a strip club DJ...
...and then I'll be ready to spark it up!
For now, though, all I can do is hole up in here and play the waiting game.

Yeah... okay. I can do that.
Mostly because I hate the thought that it could be a White Star crew member...

Man. I'm sure glad Mari knew what she was doing when it came to these pods...
...because I had clearly forgotten everything Shepherd told me.
And, like an idiot, I wasn't really paying attention when Mari did it again just now...
...so I pretty much HAVE to find Shepherd and get her back here in one piece...
...so we can both escape.
Anyway. Mari's pod launched, no problems...
...it's on a fast arc away from the White Star, with its little green light flashing...

Aw, crap, I should've asked Mari before she left.
Because if... hang on...

So. One nice thing about the drill control room --
apart from the drill, and the controls, and the roominess of it all, I mean --
is that it has all sorts of computer systems and monitors.
And that includes a dynamic map, meaning I can see where everybody is on the ship...
...so long as they're wearing a standard-issue spacesuit or gauntlet...
...which everybody -- including the three newcomers -- seems to be doing.
And, if you know where to hack -- which I'm reasonably sure I do --
you can tap into the master door grid, and lock and unlock things from here.
Which, I think, is about to prove VERY useful.

...thereby separating their ship from the White Star...
...and flying it back to the black hole, near which planet U33J6 orbits...
...so I can set off my homemade explosives just as we pass the event horizon...
...and thus eradicate these three infected marines...

So, let's see, what more can I tell you about this idea?
What I didn't mention about the homemade gunpowder earlier --
mostly because I didn't want to worry you too much --
was that fact that, of course, once I got it on board the marine ship...
...I'd need to find a way to light it.
And you wanna try to minimize the generation of open flames on spaceships.
(I mean, unless you're running experiments on open flames in spaceships...
...in which case, fire away!)
[[Ha ha. "Fire" away. Hilarious.|fire_away]] | [[So what was your plan?|fire_plan]]


:: fire_plan
I knew that, as one of his personal items, Aries had brought an old Zippo lighter.
Something he'd gotten from his dad. Inspired by an issue of the old comic book <i>Preacher.</i>
Inscribed with a phrase I won't repeat in polite company.
But anyway. The inscription isn't important.
What WAS important was the notion that, if I was VERY lucky...
...there might still be enough fluid soaked into the cotton to provide a spark.
[[If you were "VERY lucky."|lucky_dummy]] | [[A noble, but flawed, plan.|noble_flawed]]


:: lucky_dummy
Like I said, it was kind of a "tinfoil hat" plan to begin with.
The idea is to use one jar of explosive to ward off the marines...
...to keep them away from the cockpit long enough for me to plot a course to the black hole.
And then to fire up the rest of them just before we hit the event horizon...
...which should mean the ship basically blows up forever.
[[That seems... unlikely.|unlikely_plan]] | [[Is that how they work?|event_time]]

Here's the other great thing about the drill control room --
apart from all the chunks of rock that just happen to be lying around, I mean --
is that it has all sorts of computer systems and monitors.
So THAT'S fun.
Now, this isn't all the higher-end stuff that keeps the ship flying right...
...all of which is in the cockpit, and SOME of which is even working.
This stuff back here is the "brawn" to the cockpit systems' "brains."

:: plan_detailed
If the marines have a way home, they can spread their infection to Earth.
And if they stay on board the White Star...
...they'll spread it to anyone here who isn't already infected...
...and then they'll have access to TWO ships for their missionary work.
So I have to make sure they're cut off from both vessels...
...and the only way to do that, to be absolutely certain...
...is to be at the helm of one of them as it vanishes into the infinite.

I don't blame you. The way I just described this place, all the monitors...
...it probably sounds like that Sharon Stone movie <i>Sliver.</i>
Which, all things considered, is probably not the BEST movie to base my plan around.
In fact, it could easily be the WORST movie to base a plan around.
It'd definitely be the worst movie to base, like, a child's birthday party around.
But okay... here's the plan, minus cornball jokes:
[[plan_detailed]]



:: systems_do
The systems in here control the drill (duh), but there's also a dynamic map...
...so I can see where everybody is on the ship...
...so long as they're wearing a standard-issue spacesuit or gauntlet...
...which everybody -- including the three newcomers -- seems to be doing.
And, if you know where to hack -- which I'm reasonably sure I do --
you can tap into the master door grid, and lock and unlock things from here.
Which, I think, is about to prove VERY useful.
[[So you have a map and fire.^And that's your whole plan, at this point?|whole_plan]] | [[I'm a little bit lost.|little_lost]]

:: no_other_way
<<set $no_other_way_visited = true>>
I've thought through it a bunch of different ways.
I've considered locking down various rooms in the White Star...
...keeping the marines, and Artesa, in a sort of constant quarantine...
...but at the relentless rate they run door code guesses, they'd beat that system...
...simply because I couldn't stay awake indefinitely.
<<if $marilaunched is true>>Even with Captain Shepherd helping out...
...it'd be two people keeping constant vigilance...
...while ALSO trying to run an entire ship. There's just no way.
<<else>>Even with Captain Shepherd and Mari helping out...
...it'd be three people keeping constant vigilance...

<<if $explosive is true>>And I thought about blowing the drill restraints and rotating the apparatus upward...
<<else>>And I thought about somehow rigging up some explosives...
...and blowing the drill restraints and rotating the apparatus upward...<<endif>>
...so it takes out the White Star's dorsal plating...
...and then keeps going, straight through the marine ship.
But there's no time, and plus, that drill's worth more than my life.
(Honestly, it's worth more than a thousand of me dipped in gold.)
So. This is the only plan that gives Captain Aya a fighting chance...
<<if $marilaunched is true>>...and gives Shepherd the ability to steer the White Star back around...
...and pick up Mari's escape pod before it goes too far.
<<else>>...and gives Shepherd and Mari a fully functional vehicle to get home in...

But I can tell the comm - getting spotty between us
Hear the marines, they're - in here too

...Yeah. That's... what I'm doing.
How 'bout you leave this to me?
[[delay 3m^Taylor is running|cockpit_hall]]


:: marine_door
Yes. You're fascinatingly excellent at instructing me to do things...
...that I was already planning to do anyway.
I understand. It's frustrating to be a backseat driver in a spaceship.
The backseat is often MILES away.
But... I've got their ship door open.
Now I've just got to head to their cockpit.

I don't see them, not yet. But I hear them clanking around.
I think I just heard a pulse rifle's safety go off.
They do this kinda high-pitched, rising whine...
...you know what? Not important.
I just need to get through the door into the marine ship.
And...
Got it! I've got their ship door open.
Time to head to their cockpit.

Don't want - leave either

This is it
alarms blaring
hey - this is ending - just like - started
the noise is -
pushing marines down hall
right to me
they actually look
SCARED
good - love to see fear
in those glowing green eyes
We're nearing the event horizon
Things about - get crazy
<<if $tunguskite is true>>Just gonna - dump gunpowder out
all over tunguskite - in backpack
should make for - pretty fireworks
<<else>>Just gonna - dump out rest of - gunpowder<<endif>>
flint strikes steel
marines running at me
time
stretching
out
[[delay 1m|brightest_white]]


:: brightest_white
<<if $tunguskite is true>>It's the brightest white I've ever seen.
It's like everything stopped moving, but it was all still in constant motion.
Every flame was perfectly held in place. Every marine suspended in mid-leap.
Every star in the cosmos frozen in mid-twinkle.
And this ship, which should have been exploding, stretching, contorting...
...instead, it stayed perfectly still.
And yet it wrapped around me like an embrace.
Spacetime folded itself like a welcoming hug. Everyone I'd ever lost was there...
...and not there, and had always been there, and would always be.
And I looked down, and the tunguskite was glowing.
Pulsing.
Growing, its crystals expanding in my hand, overflowing my grasp.
They were beautiful and impossible.
I stared into their facets and saw myself. Saw the universe. Saw beyond the universe.
And then I felt a tap on my shoulder...
...and a stranger's voice said, "Hey, Taylor... you wanna get out of here?"

One of - monitors in cockpit - live footage
cargo hold of this ship
FILLED with occupiers
thousands - hundreds of thousands
if this ship had gotten - anywhere near - Earth

I was doing this -
kill a few of these Greens
but to kill THIS many
no choice

It's fire. Everything is fire.
There's nothing that isn't fire.
My body is fire, and my thoughts are fire, and my heart is fire.
Time is fire, and space is fire.
It stretches out in all directions, forever and ever.
I have created an explosion, and it is EVERY explosion.
All the ones that ever were, or ever will be.
And I am at the center of them.
I lit the fire, and I AM the fire, and so is everything else.
And together, we will burn.
There are no crystals to contain us. No tunguskite to divert us.
No structure that will turn this black hole into white light.
There is only the hell of fire.
And I am that hell.
And so are we all.
[[delay 30s|more_alive]]

:: more_alive
It's strange...
...I would've thought I'd be dead by now.
But if anything... I feel more alive than ever.
Burning with anima. Exploding with spirit.
Dancing at the center of an inferno, at the edge of a black hole, halfway to infinity.
Not afraid of death...
...because I've never been further from it.

Your connection to Taylor has been suspended.
The Greens' invading force has been destroyed...
...and it, along with Taylor, will explode at the edge of a black hole for the rest of eternity.
At another time... in another life... perhaps things could have been different.
This was not that time.
This was not that life.
But this cannot be the end for Taylor … can it?

Your connection to Taylor has been lost.
The Greens' invading force has been destroyed...
...and Taylor has used tunguskite to create beauty from chaos.
You have led Taylor to the best of all possible endings...
...in the best of all possible universes.
Congratulations, and thank you.
Taylor's adventures are only just beginning.

Hey there... it's Taylor.
I set this message up as a kind of failsafe...
you're seeing it because my suit thinks I'm in trouble,
and I told it that you'd know more about what might've happened than anyone else would.
We've been through a lot together, and I gotta tell you, I'm super grateful for everything you've done to help save my life.
You're the kind of person I always want in my corner... even if we're in a completely round room!

I bet I'll get out of this black hole someday -- I've gotten out of worse things and I'll want to tell you all about it.
Not to mention, I know there are other people in this big, crazy universe who could use a hand from you, too.
So I'd love to stay in touch via the occasional email. Cool?

[[Yes, let's stay in touch.|confirm_legal]] | [[No, thanks.|no_thanks_to_email]]

:: confirm_legal
You're the best. I should let you know that I haven’t quite mastered any other languages so emails will be in English only.

Alright, while I scroll to my Contacts app, the space lawyers have informed me that you have to confirm something for us to proceed.
(Yes, of COURSE there are space lawyers. Their hourly rates are ASTRONOMICAL.)

I agree to receive Lifeline marketing communications.

[[Yes|age_verify]] | [[No, thanks.|no_thanks_to_email]]

Ok, I’ll need the year of your birth to run some quick calculations.

I was born in the year <<textinput $age "[[Enter|agecheck]]">>

Everything checks out!
If you'll enter your email address for future communications,
I promise I will NEVER send you long lists of space lawyer jokes with lots of Flash animations in them.

Thanks again! You should have an email waiting for you, so be sure to check your inbox. Hurry, do it now!

Oh, and before you go, a little more fine print from those space lawyers. Their gift to you!

Rats. The space lawyers and their space calculators have informed me that we cannot put you in the system.

Whoops. There's been an error of some sort.

Don't get too worried. Whenever I'm around, things tend to break: gaming equipment, spaceships, hearts.
I just have that effect, you know?
Try shaking it vigorously, unplugging it, or blowing into it until it boots back up again the right way. (Warning: This is probably bad advice for a broken heart.)
Thanks, and sorry, and also thanks!
